# Hvað er í bíó?

## About
Hvað er í bíó? is a webapp that list all movie screenings in theaters in Iceland. The app is focused on providing an excelent user experience and solving the problem – finding a movie to see – in a efficient and intuitive manner.

## Data
Data sources:
Right now all the data comes from apis.is/cinema which relies on kvikmyndir.is but the plan is to fetch it from it's sources:
Sambíó http://www.sambio.is/xml/Schedule/
Midi.is: in arrangements about api key
Selfossbíó: has not yet made an api (and is not in the current data)

The data should be gathered in a single JSON file with the following structure:
